# Meta-Labeling:

Code base for the meta-labeling papers published with the Journal of Financial Data Science

## [Theory and Framework (Journal of Financial Data Science)](https://jfds.pm-research.com/content/early/2022/06/23/jfds.2022.1.098)

Meta-labeling is a machine learning (ML) layer that sits on top of a base primary strategy to help size positions, filter out false-positive signals, and improve metrics such as the Sharpe ratio and maximum drawdown. This article consolidates the knowledge of several publications into a single work, providing practitioners with a clear framework to support the application of meta-labeling to investment strategies. The relationships between binary classification metrics and strategy performance are explained, alongside answers to many frequently asked questions regarding the technique. The author also deconstructs meta-labeling into three components, using a controlled experiment to show how each component helps to improve strategy metrics and what types of features should be considered in the model specification phase.

## Model Architectures (Journal of Financial Data Science, Fall 2022)

Separating the side and size of a position allows for sophisticated strategy structures to be developed. Modeling the size component can be done through a meta-labeling approach. This article establishes several heterogeneous architectures to account for key aspects of meta-labeling. They serve as a guide for practitioners in the model development process, as well as for researchers to further build on these ideas. An architecture can be developed through the lens of feature- and or strategy-driven approaches. The feature-driven approach exploits the way the information in the data is structured and how the selected models use that information, while a strategy-driven approach specifically aims to incorporate unique characteristics of the underlying trading strategy. Furthermore, the concept of inverse meta-labeling is introduced as a technique to improve the quantity and quality of the side forecasts.
